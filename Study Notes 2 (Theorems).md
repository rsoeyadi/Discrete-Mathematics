## Theorem

A **theorem** is a **declarative statement about mathematics for which there is a proof.**

A **proof** is an **essay that incontrovertibly shows that a statement is true.**

In math, **there are 3 types of declarative statements**

-   **THEOREMS** - statements we know to be true because we can prove them
-   **CONJECTURES** - statements whose truth we cannot ascertain
-   **MISTAKES** - statements that are false

In mathematics the word *true* is meant to be considered absolute, unconditional, and without exception.
