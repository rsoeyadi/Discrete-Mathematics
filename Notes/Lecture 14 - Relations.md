### Antisymmetric

If there's an arrow going in one direction and it doesn't go back, it's antisymmetric

### Def (transivitity):

**R is transitive iff**

---

**Examples**



**It is reflexive if there is a loop around every element**

**It is symmetric if you have recipricols**

---

**Don't just look at the pairs you have**

The left hand side of this will never be True

**If there are no connections between elements, then it will be symmetric**

This is also **transitive**

### Def (equivalence classes): 

Let **R be an equivalence relation (symmetric, reflexive, etc.)** on **A**

All the elements related to one of the elements (students sitting in the same row)
