## Discrete Mathematics Notes

- math can be divided into *continuous* and *discrete*

### Continuous

like an analog watch

-  between 12:02 P.M. and 12:03 P.M. there are infinitely many possible different times as the second hand sweeps around the watch face
- concepts that are infinite in scope
- real-number system
- good for analyzing real world phenomena that change over time 

Continuity, derivatives, limits, differential equations

### Discrete Mathematics

like a digital watch

-  *finitely* many possible different times between 12:02 P.M. and 12:03 P.M (no split second)
- concepts that are finite in scope
- integers system
- good for analyzing real-world phenomena that change abruptly and that lie clearly in one state or another

Integers, puzzles, proof writing, induction

Good for communication, scheduling airlines, encoding movies and songs, databases, security, computer networks, etc.

Proposition Logic - **Sunny And Hot**

Inference - **If it's sunny, then I think you'll be at the beach**

Proofs - if-then proof, contradiction, by cases, counter example; smallest counter example, proof by induction

- pencil case is set; it contains elements: eraser, pencil, etc.
  - two types of collections with order and no order (set)

swim => lifeguard
